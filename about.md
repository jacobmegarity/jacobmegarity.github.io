Hello! Iâ€™m Jacob Megarity. I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. In 2024, I graduated from Texas A&M University with a B.S. in Bioenvironmental Science. During my time at Texas A&M, I worked as a research assistant under Dr. Ben Wu and Justin Wied, where I contributed to projects investigating the effects of climate change and rangeland management systems on prairie biodiversity, animal behavior, and livestock production in Texas. 

Currently, I am assisting in research at the Flow Dynamics and Turbulence Lab at UT Dallas. Here, our research focuses on the small-scale turbulence at the air-sea interface and its role in momentum and energy transfer, gas exchange, and the overall sea state and climate. In addition to my work, I am also taking courses in mathematics and physics to strengthen my background and better prepare for graduate school.

In the upcoming fall, I plan to apply to graduate programs in physical oceanography and climate sciences for Fall 2026. My research interests center around ocean-atmosphere interactions and climate change & variability. I am also very interested in studying how these physical processes impact the ocean's carbon cycle and marine ecosystems. 

Outside of work and school, I enjoy reading (big fan of fiction, particularly fantasy), watching sports (mainly hockey - go Dallas Stars!), spending time with my dogs Louie and Maya, going to the gym, and finding exciting new movies and TV shows to watch.
